A single-click virtual screening tool using AutoDock4 for Windows users (Version 1.0)

This version is more user-friendly and easier to use, while the usage instructions remain the same.

Required installations :
- Python (preferably 3.0 or higher)
- MGLTools 1.5.7 (https://ccsb.scripps.edu/mgltools/downloads/)
- OpenBabel 3.1.1 (https://github.com/openbabel/openbabel/releases/tag/openbabel-3-1-1)
- AutoDock 4.2.6 (https://autodock.scripps.edu/download-autodock4/)

This code may not be sold, redistributed, or used for commercial purposes without explicit permission from the author.

The author acknowledges the assistance received in the development of this code specifically from Professor MENAD Rafik (University of Algiers, Algeria). This code relies on or integrates with other software or libraries, each with its own licensing terms. Users are responsible for reviewing and complying with the licensing terms of any third-party dependencies used in conjunction with this code.

In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claim, damages, or other liability, whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise, arising from, out of, or in connection with the use or performance of this code.

Usage :

1- Install the required software

2- Download SwiftDock.bat or copy the source code to a text file and save it as a BAT file (the file could be converted to an executable "EXE" file) 

3- Put the BAT/EXE file in a folder, containing the ligand SDF files and the protein PDB file, and execute the program


PS: *The required programs should be installed in the destination folders defined in the source code :

MGLTools : "C:\Program Files (x86)\MGLTools-1.5.7"

OpenBabel : "C:\Program Files\OpenBabel-3.1.1"

AutoDock4 : "C:\Program Files (x86)\The Scripps Research Institute\Autodock\4.2.6"

However, the destination folders in the source code could be modified to accomodate the users' needs.

*The "SwiftDock.bat" file is designed to execute blind docking by default. To perform site-specific docking, users can modify the grid box dimensions and center to suit their specific needs (see the main code for details).
